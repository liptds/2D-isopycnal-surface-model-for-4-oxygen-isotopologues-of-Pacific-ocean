# 2-D isopycnal model for multi-oxygen-isotopologues of Pacific ocean

1. The original model is presented in this file as the following.

2. The isopycnal surface with photosynthesis model \sigma_\theta 25.8-26.2 is in the folder of 25.8-26.2. There are instructions
 
in model2D on how to switch to respiration-only mode.

3. The isopycnal surface \sigma_\theta 26.5-26.9 is in the folder of 26.5-26.9. There are instructions in model2D on how to switch to implicit-photosynthesis mode.
